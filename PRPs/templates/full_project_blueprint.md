Comprehensive Project Blueprint: An API-Driven Amazon Product Intelligence Platform

Section 1: Strategic Architectural Blueprint

This section establishes the high-level strategic and technical foundation for the project. It outlines the system's core philosophy, visualizes the interaction between components, justifies the technology stack, and details the end-to-end security model.

1.1 System Overview and Core Philosophy

The proposed system is an API-first, credit-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed to provide users with on-demand Amazon product information. The architectural philosophy is centered on a decoupled, microservices-oriented approach, promoting a clean separation of concerns. This design paradigm is crucial for organizing development efforts, particularly when distinct frontend and backend teams are involved, and ensures the system is built for scalability and maintainability from day one.1
The architecture comprises three primary, independent services:
Frontend Application (React): A modern, responsive single-page application (SPA) responsible for all user-facing interactions, including presenting data, managing user input, and handling the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
Backend API (FastAPI): The central nervous system of the platform. This service handles all business logic, orchestrates calls to external APIs, manages the credit system, processes payments, and serves as the secure gateway between the frontend and the database.
Backend-as-a-Service (Supabase): This platform serves two critical functions. First, it provides a robust, scalable PostgreSQL database for data persistence. Second, and more importantly, it acts as the dedicated, secure authentication provider for the entire system, managing user identities and issuing access tokens.2
This separation ensures that each component can be developed, tested, deployed, and scaled independently, creating a resilient and agile system.

1.2 High-Level Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the complete data and request flow within the system, from user interaction to data retrieval and persistence. It highlights the decoupled nature of the services and the secure communication pathways.

Authentication Flow (Steps 1-4): The user interacts with the React frontend to sign up or log in via Supabase Auth. Supabase returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) to the client. This JWT is then included in all subsequent requests to the FastAPI backend, which validates the token's authenticity before processing the request.4
API Query Flow (Steps 5-8): An authenticated user submits a query from the React app. The FastAPI backend receives the request, deducts the appropriate credits, and orchestrates calls to the necessary external APIs (asindataapi or the FNSKU service). It logs the query and returns the processed data to the frontend.
Payment Flow (Steps 9-14): The user initiates a credit purchase. The backend creates a secure checkout session with Stripe. Upon successful payment, Stripe notifies the backend via a webhook, and the backend securely updates the user's credit balance in the Supabase database.6

1.3 Technology Stack Justification

The selection of technologies is based on performance, developer experience, scalability, and the robust ecosystem supporting each component.
React (Frontend): React is the industry standard for building dynamic and complex user interfaces. Its component-based architecture promotes reusability and maintainability. The project will be initialized using Vite, a modern build tool that offers a significantly faster and more efficient development experience compared to older tools like Create React App.8 The vast ecosystem of libraries for routing, state management, and UI components makes React an ideal choice for building the required user and admin dashboards.10
FastAPI (Backend): FastAPI is a high-performance Python web framework designed for building APIs. Its primary advantage is its asynchronous nature, built on ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface), which allows it to handle many concurrent I/O-bound operations—such as calling external APIs—with exceptional efficiency.2 This is critical for an application whose core function is to proxy requests to other services. Furthermore, FastAPI's use of Python type hints and Pydantic models provides automatic request/response validation and interactive API documentation (via Swagger UI), which drastically reduces development time and minimizes bugs.2
Supabase (Database & Authentication): Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a suite of backend tools built around a PostgreSQL database.3 It is selected for its integrated, developer-friendly platform. While its PostgreSQL database provides a powerful and familiar SQL interface, its most significant immediate benefit is its production-grade
Authentication service. Leveraging Supabase Auth for user management (including sign-up, password management, email verification, and social logins) and JWT issuance removes a significant security and development burden from the FastAPI backend.11 Direct database connection from FastAPI will be handled using an asynchronous driver like
asyncpg to maintain the performance benefits of the ASGI server.2

1.4 The End-to-End Security Model: A JWT-Powered Architecture

A robust security model is paramount. The architecture is designed around the industry-standard JSON Web Token (JWT) flow, which ensures that communication between the client and the backend is stateless and secure. This approach offloads the complexity of authentication management to Supabase, a specialized service built for this purpose, allowing the FastAPI backend to focus solely on authorization and business logic.
The authentication process is as follows:
Client-Side Authentication: The React application will use the official @supabase/supabase-js client library to interact directly with the Supabase Auth service.11 When a user signs up or logs in, their credentials are sent securely to Supabase, not to the FastAPI backend.
JWT Issuance: Upon successful authentication, Supabase generates and returns two tokens to the client: a short-lived Access Token (JWT) and a long-lived Refresh Token.4 The access token is used to authenticate requests, while the refresh token is used to silently obtain a new access token when the old one expires, providing a seamless user session.
Authenticated API Requests: For any request to a protected endpoint on the FastAPI server, the React client will include the access token in the HTTP Authorization header, using the Bearer schema (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>).4
Backend Token Validation: The FastAPI backend will protect its routes using a dependency injection system. A custom JWTBearer class will be implemented to automatically validate the token on every incoming request. This validation process involves several crucial steps 5:
Extracting the token from the Authorization header.
Decoding the JWT using the shared JWT Secret Key, which is configured in both the Supabase project settings and the FastAPI application's environment variables. This secret must be protected rigorously.
Verifying the token's signature to ensure it was issued by Supabase and has not been tampered with.
Checking the token's claims, such as its expiration time (exp), to ensure it is still valid.
If the token is valid, the request is allowed to proceed to the endpoint handler. If it is invalid, expired, or missing, FastAPI will automatically return a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden error. This architecture ensures that the backend never handles sensitive user credentials like passwords and relies on a trusted, verifiable token for authorization, which is a highly secure and scalable pattern for modern web applications.15

Section 2: Backend Architecture and Core Logic with FastAPI

This section provides a detailed blueprint for the backend development, covering the project's structure, API endpoint definitions, and a strategy for integrating with external services, including a critical risk assessment for the FNSKU-to-ASIN conversion feature.

2.1 Project Structure for Scalability

To ensure long-term maintainability and accommodate future growth, a modular project structure is essential. This structure separates concerns, making the codebase easier to navigate, test, and extend, avoiding the pitfalls of a single, monolithic main.py file.3
The recommended directory structure is as follows:

/app
├── api/
│ ├── **init**.py
│ └── v1/
│ ├── **init**.py
│ ├── endpoints/
│ │ ├── auth.py # Endpoints related to user info
│ │ ├── queries.py # Core product query endpoints
│ │ ├── credits.py # Stripe checkout and payment endpoints
│ │ └── admin.py # Endpoints for the admin dashboard
│ └── schemas/
│ ├── user_schemas.py # Pydantic models for user data
│ ├── query_schemas.py # Pydantic models for query requests/responses
│ └── credit_schemas.py # Pydantic models for credit transactions
├── core/
│ ├── **init**.py
│ ├── config.py # Pydantic-based settings management for env variables
│ └── security.py # JWT validation dependency and security utilities
├── crud/
│ ├── **init**.py
│ ├── crud_user.py # Functions for DB operations on the 'profiles' table
│ ├── crud_query.py # Functions for DB operations on the 'query_logs' table
│ └── crud_credit.py # Functions for DB operations on the 'credit_transactions' table
├── services/
│ ├── **init**.py
│ ├── asindata_service.py # Logic for interacting with the asindataapi
│ └── fnsku_service.py # Logic for the FNSKU-to-ASIN conversion service
└── main.py # FastAPI application entry point, mounts API routers

This structure provides a clear separation:
api: Contains all versioned API logic, including endpoint definitions (endpoints) and their corresponding data structures (schemas).
core: Holds application-wide configuration (config.py) and security logic (security.py).
crud: Abstracts all direct database interactions (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Endpoints will call functions from this layer instead of talking to the database directly.
services: Encapsulates the logic for communicating with all external, third-party APIs.

2.2 API Endpoint Specification

The API serves as the contract between the frontend and backend. Defining it explicitly with strong typing using Pydantic models is a core strength of FastAPI.2 The following table specifies the primary endpoints for the application.
Endpoint Path

2.3 External API Integration and Risk Mitigation

The backend's primary role is to orchestrate calls to external services. Each integration will be encapsulated within its own module in the /services directory for modularity and ease of testing.

2.3.1 asindataapi Integration

A dedicated service module, services/asindata_service.py, will manage all interactions with the ASIN Data API.
Connection: The service will use an asynchronous HTTP client like httpx to make non-blocking requests, which is crucial for maintaining the performance of the FastAPI application.
Request Construction: It will dynamically build the request URL based on user input and system rules, including parameters like api_key, type, amazon_domain, and asin as specified in the API documentation.16
Security: The asindataapi API key will be stored as an environment variable and loaded via the core/config.py module. It will never be hardcoded in the source code.2
Response Handling: The service will parse the JSON response from the API, extract the relevant product data, and calculate the credit cost based on the complexity and volume of the data returned (e.g., presence of reviews, A+ content, etc.).16

2.3.2 The FNSKU-to-ASIN Conversion Challenge and Mitigation Strategy

A significant technical risk has been identified with the FNSKU-to-ASIN conversion requirement. This risk stems not just from a broken link but from the fundamental nature of the identifiers themselves.
Problem Analysis: An ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) is a public, global identifier for a product on Amazon's catalog.17 In contrast, an FNSKU (Fulfillment Network Stock Keeping Unit) is an
internal barcode used by Amazon's FBA system. It is seller-specific and links a particular product unit to a specific seller's inventory within an Amazon fulfillment center.17 This distinction is critical: because an FNSKU is tied to a seller's private inventory, there is no official, public Amazon API designed to perform this conversion for arbitrary FNSKUs. Amazon's own Selling Partner (SP-API) allows sellers to manage their
own inventory and map their SKUs/FNSKUs to ASINs, but it cannot be used by a third-party application to look up identifiers belonging to other sellers.19 The user-provided API endpoint is inaccessible 22, and the market lacks a clear, reliable, developer-focused API for this task.
Mitigation Plan: This feature must be treated as high-risk and approached with a phased strategy.
Stage 1: Focused R&D (Time-boxed): A dedicated, time-boxed research spike (e.g., 1-2 weeks) will be conducted to exhaustively search for a niche, reliable third-party API provider. This will include attempting to contact the developers of existing tools, such as the one behind the fnskutoasin.com Chrome extension 23, to inquire about API access.
Stage 2: Architect a Fallback Solution (Web Scraping): In parallel, the architecture for a fallback mechanism will be designed. This would involve creating a resilient, scalable web scraping service. This service would need to be sophisticated enough to manage a pool of proxies, handle CAPTCHAs, and adapt to changes in Amazon's website structure. This approach introduces significant technical complexity, ongoing maintenance costs, and potential legal and ethical considerations regarding Amazon's terms of service.
Stage 3: Business and Product Decision: The findings from Stage 1 and the cost/complexity analysis from Stage 2 will be presented to project stakeholders. This will enable an informed decision on how to proceed. The options include:
De-scope for MVP: Remove the FNSKU query feature from the initial product launch to focus on the reliable ASIN functionality.
Launch as Beta: Release the feature using the scraping fallback but label it clearly as "Beta," setting user expectations about its potential reliability issues.
Premium Pricing: Implement the scraping solution and price FNSKU queries at a significantly higher credit cost to reflect their higher operational complexity and maintenance overhead.

Section 3: Data Persistence and Authentication with Supabase

This section outlines the database schema design within Supabase's PostgreSQL environment and details the implementation of its authentication and security features.

3.1 Database Schema Design

A well-structured database is the foundation of the application. The schema is designed to be normalized, ensuring data integrity, minimizing redundancy, and providing a clear structure for storing user data, credit transactions, and query history.
The following tables will be created in the public schema of the Supabase project.
Table Name

jsonb
Nullable. A summary of the data returned, for display purposes.

status
text
NOT NULL. ENUM ('success', 'error', 'not_found').

3.2 Implementing Row Level Security (RLS)

To enforce strict data privacy and security at the database layer, Row Level Security (RLS) will be enabled on all tables. RLS ensures that database queries executed on behalf of a user can only access rows that belong to that user, regardless of the application logic. This is a powerful feature of Supabase and PostgreSQL that provides a critical security backstop.8
The following SQL commands will be executed in the Supabase SQL Editor:

SQL

-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.credit_transactions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.query_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies for the 'profiles' table
-- Users can see their own profile.
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile."
ON public.profiles FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Users can update their own profile.
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile."
ON public.profiles FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Create policies for 'credit_transactions' and 'query_logs'
-- Users can only see their own transactions and logs.
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own credit transactions."
ON public.credit_transactions FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own query logs."
ON public.query_logs FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Note: INSERT operations for transactions and logs will be handled by the backend
-- using the service_role key, bypassing RLS for trusted server-side operations.

3.3 Authentication Flow Deep Dive

The authentication flow will be implemented using Supabase's dedicated libraries to ensure a seamless and secure user experience.
Frontend (React): To accelerate development and provide a modern UI, the @supabase/auth-ui-react library is the recommended choice.11 This single component can handle user sign-up, sign-in, password recovery, and social logins with minimal configuration.
Implementation: The Auth component will be configured with the Supabase client instance and a theme. Global session state will be managed by listening to supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange. This listener updates a global state store (e.g., Zustand) whenever the user's authentication state changes (e.g., SIGNED_IN, SIGNED_OUT), making the session information available throughout the entire application.25
Backend (FastAPI): The backend's role is to validate the JWT provided by the frontend. This logic will be encapsulated in the core/security.py module.
Implementation: A class JWTBearer will be created, inheriting from fastapi.security.HTTPBearer. This class will be used as a dependency (Depends(JWTBearer())) on any protected API endpoint. Its **call** method will automatically execute on each request, performing the token validation.
An example implementation of the validation logic within JWTBearer:Python

# In core/security.py

import os
from fastapi import Request, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer
from jose import jwt, JWTError
from core.config import settings # Pydantic settings

class JWTBearer(HTTPBearer):
async def **call**(self, request: Request):
credentials = await super().**call**(request)
if not credentials:
raise HTTPException(
status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
detail="Invalid or no credentials provided."
)
try:
payload = jwt.decode(
credentials.credentials,
settings.SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET,
algorithms=,
audience="authenticated"
) # Optionally, attach user ID to the request state # request.state.user_id = payload.get("sub")
except JWTError:
raise HTTPException(
status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
detail="Invalid token or expired token."
)
return credentials.credentials
This code snippet demonstrates how to use the python-jose library to decode the token with the shared secret, ensuring that only valid, unexpired tokens issued by Supabase are accepted by the backend.4

Section 4: Monetization: The Credit and Payment Engine

This section details the business logic of the application, focusing on the credit-based usage system and the integration with Stripe for payment processing.

4.1 The Credit System Mechanics

The platform's monetization model is built on a flexible credit system. Users purchase credits, which are then consumed to execute queries. The cost of each query is dynamic, reflecting the computational resources and data costs associated with the request.
This dynamic pricing is governed by a clear set of rules, which can be configured and adjusted as the service evolves. The core principle is that more complex or data-intensive requests consume more credits. This model allows for fair pricing that scales with the value delivered to the user.
The following matrix defines the initial credit cost structure. This logic will be implemented in the backend and consulted before any credits are deducted from a user's balance.
Query Type
Parameter / Data Field
Base Cost (Credits)
Additional Cost (Credits)
Notes
product
(Base Request)
1
N/A
Cost for a standard product data request by ASIN.
product
include_offers=true
N/A
+1
Additional cost for fetching competing offers data.
product
include_reviews=true
N/A
+2
Additional cost for fetching and parsing top reviews.
product
include_a_plus_content=true
N/A
+1
Additional cost for fetching A+ content.
search
(Base Request)
3
N/A
Higher base cost for a search results page.
fnsku
(Base Request)
10
N/A
Significantly higher base cost due to the complexity and operational overhead of the FNSKU-to-ASIN conversion service.

When a user executes a query, the backend will:
Authenticate the user and check their current credit_balance.
Calculate the total credit cost of the requested query based on the matrix above.
If the user has insufficient credits, return an error.
If credits are sufficient, execute the query to the external API.
Upon successful completion, atomically deduct the credits from the user's credit_balance and log the query and transaction in the query_logs and credit_transactions tables, respectively.

4.2 Stripe Integration for Credit Purchases

Stripe is the industry-standard choice for payment processing and will be integrated to handle credit purchases securely and reliably.6 The integration will use Stripe Checkout, a pre-built, hosted payment page that simplifies PCI compliance and provides a seamless user experience.27
The payment flow is a multi-step process designed for security and reliability:
Checkout Initiation (Client & Backend): The user selects a credit pack to purchase in the React frontend. The client sends a request to a dedicated backend endpoint, e.g., /api/v1/credits/checkout-session. The backend receives this request, verifies the user is authenticated, and uses the Stripe Python library to create a Checkout Session. Crucially, the user's unique ID (profiles.id) is passed to Stripe in the client_reference_id field of the session object. The backend then returns the session URL to the client.7
Redirect to Stripe: The frontend redirects the user to the secure Stripe-hosted checkout page using the URL provided by the backend. The user completes the payment directly on Stripe's domain.
Payment Fulfillment (Stripe Webhook): This is the most critical step. After a successful payment, Stripe sends an asynchronous checkout.session.completed event to a dedicated webhook endpoint on the FastAPI backend (e.g., /api/v1/webhooks/stripe). This endpoint must not be protected by the standard JWT authentication but by verifying the Stripe signature included in the request headers. This ensures the request is genuinely from Stripe and has not been forged.
Credit Allocation (Backend): The webhook handler must be designed for resilience. A synchronous approach where the handler directly updates the database can be brittle; if a database connection fails, the entire transaction might fail, forcing Stripe to retry and potentially leading to duplicate credit grants.
A more robust architecture involves the webhook endpoint acting as a lightweight receiver. Its sole responsibilities are:
Verify the Stripe signature to authenticate the event.
Acknowledge receipt immediately with a 200 OK response to Stripe.
Place the event payload onto a background task queue (using FastAPI's built-in BackgroundTasks for simplicity, or a more robust system like Celery for high-volume applications).
The background task then handles the core logic: it parses the event, extracts the client_reference_id (the user's ID), and performs the database transaction to add the purchased credits to the user's credit_balance and log the transaction. This asynchronous handling ensures the API is responsive and reliable, even under load or during temporary database issues.28

Section 5: Frontend Architecture with React

This section details the plan for constructing the frontend application, covering project setup, UI component strategy, state management, and application structure to create a modern, performant, and user-friendly interface.

5.1 Project Setup and Tooling

The foundation of a successful frontend project lies in its setup and tooling. To ensure a modern and efficient development workflow, the following stack is recommended:
Initialization: The project will be bootstrapped using Vite with the React and TypeScript template: npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts.8 Vite provides a significantly faster development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds compared to older toolchains.
Code Quality: To maintain a clean and consistent codebase, ESLint and Prettier will be configured. ESLint will enforce code quality rules and catch potential bugs, while Prettier will automatically format code on save, eliminating stylistic debates and ensuring uniformity across the development team.

5.2 UI Component Library Selection

The choice of a UI library is pivotal in defining the application's look and feel and accelerating development. The requirement for a "modern and easy to use" interface suggests a need for a flexible, aesthetically pleasing, and highly functional library. A hybrid approach is recommended to leverage the best tools for different parts of the application.
Main Application & Marketing Pages: For the primary user-facing areas, Shadcn UI combined with Tailwind CSS is the recommended choice.29 Shadcn UI is not a traditional component library; instead, it provides beautifully designed, accessible components that are copied directly into the project's codebase. This approach offers maximum control and customizability, allowing for the creation of a unique brand identity without being locked into a specific design system's opinions. Tailwind CSS provides the utility-first framework for styling these components efficiently.30
Admin Dashboard: For the data-intensive admin dashboard, MUI (Material UI), specifically its advanced MUI X components, is the ideal choice.31 MUI provides a comprehensive suite of production-ready components, including powerful data grids, charts, and forms, which are essential for building complex administrative interfaces quickly and effectively. Its robust theming system can be configured to align with the main application's branding.29
This dual-library strategy uses the right tool for the job: maximum design freedom for the public-facing site and maximum functional efficiency for the internal admin panel.

5.3 State Management Strategy

Modern React development has moved beyond using a single, monolithic state management library for all purposes. A differentiated, purpose-driven approach to state management is more performant and maintainable.33 The application's state can be categorized into three distinct types, each with an optimal tool.
Server State: This refers to data that resides on the backend and is fetched asynchronously, such as the user's profile, credit balance, query history, and the results of Amazon product lookups. TanStack Query (formerly React Query) is the definitive tool for managing server state.33 It handles caching, background data synchronization, loading and error states, and request deduplication out of the box. Wrapping all API calls to the FastAPI backend in
useQuery (for data fetching) and useMutation (for data modification) hooks will drastically simplify data-fetching logic and improve the user experience by providing a responsive, cached-first interface.
Global Client State: This is state that needs to be shared across many components but does not persist on the server, such as the user's authentication status (e.g., the session object from Supabase) or the UI theme (e.g., light/dark mode). For this, a full-scale library like Redux is unnecessary overhead. A lightweight, hook-based library like Zustand is a superior choice. It offers a minimal API, requires no boilerplate provider wrappers, and is highly performant.33 A single Zustand store will be created to hold the user's session, which will be updated by the
onAuthStateChange listener from Supabase.
Local Component State: For state that is confined to a single component, such as the value of a form input or the open/closed state of a modal, React's built-in useState and useReducer hooks are the most appropriate and efficient tools.36
This layered strategy ensures that the complexity of the state management solution matches the complexity of the state it is managing, leading to a more performant and easier-to-debug application.

5.4 Component and Routing Architecture

The application will be structured logically using a combination of file-based organization and a robust routing system.
Routing: The react-router-dom library will be used to manage all client-side routing. A key component will be a custom ProtectedRoute wrapper.37 This component will check the global authentication state from the Zustand store. If a user is not authenticated, it will automatically redirect them to the
/login page, effectively securing all dashboard and account-related routes.25
Component Structure: The /src/components directory will be organized by feature or domain. The primary dashboards will be composed of smaller, reusable components:
User Dashboard: Will be composed of components like QueryInputForm, QueryResultDisplay, CreditBalanceIndicator, PurchaseCreditsModal, and QueryHistoryTable.
Admin Dashboard: Will be composed of powerful components, likely from MUI X, such as UserManagementDataGrid, SystemAnalyticsCharts, and CreditTransactionLogsViewer. This component-based architecture ensures a modular and scalable frontend codebase.

Section 6: Deployment, Operations, and Go-to-Market Strategy

This final section outlines the plan for deploying, operating, and maintaining the application, ensuring a smooth transition from development to a live, production environment.

6.1 CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is essential for automating testing and deployment, leading to faster release cycles and higher quality software. GitHub Actions will be used to orchestrate this pipeline.
Two primary workflows will be created in the .github/workflows/ directory:
test-and-lint.yml: This workflow will be triggered on every push to a pull request. It will execute a series of checks on both the frontend and backend codebases, including:
Installing all dependencies.
Running linters (ESLint for React, a tool like ruff or flake8 for Python) to enforce code style.
Executing the full suite of unit and integration tests.
A pull request will be blocked from merging until all checks pass, ensuring code quality is maintained in the main branch.
deploy.yml: This workflow will be triggered upon a successful merge to the main branch. It will perform the following steps automatically:
Build the production-optimized React application.
Build a containerized version of the FastAPI application using Docker.
Deploy the React build to its hosting provider (Vercel).
Push the Docker image to a container registry and deploy it to its hosting provider (Render).

6.2 Hosting and Infrastructure

A multi-platform hosting strategy is recommended to leverage the strengths of specialized providers for each part of the technology stack. This approach is often more cost-effective and performant than attempting to host everything on a single, generic platform like AWS EC2, especially for a project of this scale.38
Frontend (React): The static frontend application will be deployed to Vercel. Vercel is purpose-built for hosting modern JavaScript frameworks like React. It offers seamless integration with GitHub for automated deployments, a global content delivery network (CDN) for fast load times worldwide, automatic SSL certificate provisioning, and preview deployments for every pull request.
Backend (FastAPI): The FastAPI application will be deployed to Render. Render is a modern Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that greatly simplifies backend deployment. It can deploy the application directly from a Docker container, manage environment variables securely, provide auto-scaling capabilities, and handle the underlying infrastructure, allowing the development team to focus on code rather than server management.
Database & Auth (Supabase): Supabase provides its own fully managed cloud hosting. The project will utilize the Supabase cloud platform, which handles database backups, scaling, and security, eliminating the need for self-hosting a PostgreSQL instance.

6.3 Environment and Secrets Management

To ensure stability and security, the application will operate across multiple environments, typically development, staging, and production. A critical component of this strategy is the secure management of secrets.
All sensitive information—including database connection strings, API keys, and JWT secrets—will be managed as environment variables. These secrets will never be committed to the Git repository in plain text.2
SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: Public keys for the client-side application.39
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET: Highly sensitive keys for the backend.4
ASINDATA_API_KEY: The key for the external product data API.16
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: The secret keys for processing payments and verifying webhooks.6
These variables will be stored securely in the settings of their respective hosting platforms (Vercel and Render for production/staging) and in GitHub Repository Secrets for use in the CI/CD pipeline. For local development, they will be stored in a .env file that is listed in the .gitignore file.

6.4 Logging and Monitoring

Effective logging and monitoring are non-negotiable for maintaining a healthy production application. They are essential for debugging issues, understanding system performance, and identifying errors before they impact a large number of users.
Structured Logging: The FastAPI application will implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for all events, errors, and important transactions. This makes logs easily searchable and machine-readable.
Centralized Logging Service: Both the frontend and backend applications will be integrated with a third-party error tracking and logging service like Sentry or Datadog. These platforms provide a centralized dashboard to aggregate logs and errors from all parts of the system. Sentry, for example, can capture unhandled exceptions in the React frontend and link them to the corresponding API request that failed on the FastAPI backend, providing a complete trace for rapid debugging. This proactive monitoring is crucial for ensuring the reliability and stability of the platform post-launch.
